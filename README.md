# 🩺 Pacientes Zustand – React + Zustand Practice App

**Pacientes Zustand** is a simple CRUD-style React application focused on managing patient records.  
It uses **Zustand** for state management — offering a lightweight and intuitive alternative to more complex solutions like Redux.  
This app is part of my learning journey with **React** and modern state tools.

## 🎯 Purpose
